# Assignment 2: MyPolynomial

**Overview:** The program must be submitted to our grader on Tuesday, October 6. Before submitting, zip all
your files, and email a single zipped file as attachment. Remember that your code should be fully
documented. In addition, you have to submit a hard-copy of your code at the start of class on the
due date.
The goal of this assignment is to implement a MyPolynomial class that represents single-variable
polynomials (with nonnegative exponents) by using a CIRCULAR doubly linked list. Each term in
the polynomial can be stored in one node containing its coefficient and exponent. The nodes are
sorted in decreasing order of exponents.
