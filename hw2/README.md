# Assignment 2: MyPolynomial

**Overview:** The goal of this assignment is to implement a MyPolynomial class that represents single-variable
polynomials (with nonnegative exponents) by using a CIRCULAR doubly linked list. Each term in
the polynomial can be stored in one node containing its coefficient and exponent. The nodes are
sorted in decreasing order of exponents.
