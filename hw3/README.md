# Assignment 3: KD-Trees

**Overview:** This assignment generalizes binary search trees to allow searching on 2-dimensional keys, such as Points 
in 2D. Such a tree is called a kd-tree for k-dimensional tree. In this assignment k =2. A regular Binary Search Tree 
can only insert the points searching using either the x or y coordinate, but not both. The idea in a kd-tree is that, 
at each level, the tree compares against one dimension (called cutting dimension). The cutting dimension cycles through 
dimensions as you walk down the tree. For example, a 2D kd-tree first compares on the x coordinate to decide whether to 
go to the left or right of a node, then at the next level compares on the y coordinate. Then itâ€™s back to x again.
